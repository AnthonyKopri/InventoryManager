# InventoryManager
Easy inventory manager script to create and manage inventory

**To implement the manager correctly, please make sure:**
- Add ItemInfo.cs script to items you want to be picked.
- Change "type" string in ItemInfo.cs to the type of the item.
- Insert the variaton of the inventory manager script you find useful to the game object you want to add an inventory.

##InventoryManager.cs
This is a text based inventory manager. It is mostly to keep track of items that you dont want to re-summon but rather keep it as a value.

##InventoryObjManager.
This is a GameObject based manager. It keeps track of the GameObjects and re-summons them at will. 

###More syntax and function info will be added.
